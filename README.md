# Show HTML Source Code
This class can show highlighted HTML source of the current web page.

It can generate highlighted HTML source code using PHP form the current page. It calls a script that will use the PHP class to retrieve the page HTML source and output it in a user-friendly fashion on the end-users web browser using JavaScript.

This project also includes a replacement context menu (right click). This context menu also supports keyboard shortcuts using JavaScript keyboard event triggers.

## Features
