# Show HTML Source Code

> **Show HTML Source Code** (a.k.a. **middleFinger**)

This class can show highlighted HTML source of the current web page.

It can generate highlighted HTML source code using PHP form the current page. It calls a script that will use the PHP class to retrieve the page HTML source and output it in a user-friendly fashion on the end-users web browser using JavaScript.

This project also includes a replacement context menu (right click). This context menu also supports keyboard shortcuts using JavaScript keyboard event triggers.

## Features

The following is a list of features this project comes packaged with.
 * CSS style-sheets for easy customization.
 * A replacement context menu to replace the browser's default right click menu.
 * Context menu comes with optional sub menus for better organization.
 * Keyboard shortcuts. (e.g. _Ctrl + U_; View Source, _BKSP_; go back to the previous web page)
 * An example page (index.htm) for an easy quick-start.
 * The output source code is also generated with line numbers.
